## ðŸ“˜ Learning & Development
- Watched this [video from reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/1957ngc/rare_tank_battle_between_ukrainian_bradley_and/) of a tank battle between a Ukrainian Bradley, which sent me down a bit of a rabbit hole. [This is the same video, but narrated and annotated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKvmpcLbZFA) which makes it a little bit easier to understand. I then ended up on this incredible [30 minutes of go-pro footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYvMc-tQvkM) from an American fighting on the front lines. This era of high-definition imagery in near-realtime from battlefields across the world is very strange.

I've been watching a lot of YouTube videos from survival/prepper/outdoors folks and one thing I keep noticing is that people will do a whole 10 minute video on some sort of preparation, but never actually talk about the situation they are preparing for. This is especially noticeable in YouTube videos about radios or military equipment.

These guys keep talking about having equipment to navigate and survive in "non-permissive environments" with their Every Day Carry or Bug Out Bags. In Cybersecurity, the first step towards building a defense is to create a [Threat Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_model) that describes the likely motives and tactics of potential attackers.

### Experimenting with Tres js

Tres JS <https://tresjs.org> is a Vue wrapper around the 3D web graphics library Three.js- and it makes it very easy to integrate 3D scenes into Vue components using Vue's reactivity system, and making it easy to pull in other helpers like VueUse. So far, I am enjoying the technology, but finding the documentation and examples a bit lacking, so I am finding myself stumbling around aimlessly sometimes.
