## ðŸŒŸ Overview of the Week


## Projects Worked On

### knowhv.com

Working on the homepage / index styling a bit, trying to find a balance between the map and the list of posts, and imagining the ways people would explore the content using both mechanisms.

### ejfox.photos

Continuing on my lifelong quest to have a photoblog that I like the design of and is easy to update, I have been working on tuning up ejfox.photos - a domain I acquired a year ago and havenâ€™t used properly so far.

The main page is meant to imitate a table with a bunch of printed photos splayed out on it, the most recent at the top. Clicking on an image shows the EXIF data, a map if a lat/lng is attached to the image, and most importantly the EXIF caption, which can be easily edited in the iOS Photos app.

### Room 302 Mission Control

### Coach Artie & Brain View

Worked on a blog post for the studio blog going over all of the features we have added to Coach Artie in the past few months

Also worked on the Brain View. Started sending all of the Winston logs to a supabase log table so that can be shown alongside memories and messages. I want to make it a more fully-functional backend, with the ability to edit prompts and change configuration values on-the-fly. It would also be good to see all schedules in pg_cron.

## Creative Endeavors
