## Opening Image - Intriguing Start

Are you ever playing a video game or trying to point something out to a friend, but struggle to get them to see what you are seeing? This is actually a skill that can be practiced. It's not only important for video games, it can also be incredibly useful in real life situations where time, speed, and accuracy in communications might be the difference between life and death.

## Immediate Entry Point - Introduction

Start with a narrative punch – either a thought-provoking statement, intriguing question, or a surprising fact related to your topic. This strategy quickly immerses your audience in the topic at hand and kickstarts the intellectual journey.

## 'Ordinary World' Deconstruction - Unveiling the Topic

Initiate the exploration of your 'ordinary world' by presenting an unexpected angle, anomaly, or puzzle in your complex topic. By highlighting what is about to be deconstructed and understood in the upcoming segments, you foster curiosity, encouraging viewers to remain engaged as the mystery unravels.

## Presenting 'The Call to Adventure' - Launch Segments

Here, lay out the first step of the deeper exploration. Divide the complex topic into segments, each examining a unique element. Like Dan Harmon’s story circle, this initial segment should present a challenge or question that disrupts the ordinary world.

## 'Crossing the Threshold' and 'Road of Trials' - Segment Walkthrough

Delve into your subject's different segments in depth. Each segment should represent a challenge or stage that, when conquered or comprehended, brings viewers closer to understanding the abstract or complex topic.

## 'Master of Both Worlds' - Summarization and Key Takeaways

With a nod to Harmon’s structure, provide a summary that shows viewers how what they’ve learned has reshaped the 'ordinary world'. Highlight the key takeaways that viewers can utilize or relate to their own lives.

## Viewer Engagement - Call-to-Actions

Promote interaction with direct calls-to-action, such as "subscribe," "like," or comment prompts for further discussion. Include participation elements that keep the conversation going beyond the video. Encourage your audience to share how the video's lessons could apply in their worlds.

## Return - Final Message

Cap off with appreciative closing remarks. Thank the audience for their time and interaction, share what's coming next if appropriate, or leave viewers with an inspiring thought to keep them thinking about your topic even after the video ends.
