    "extended": "Much of the focus was on Steve Kornacki as he tapped around his “big board,” a large interactive map of the U.S. where he factored together stats on various candidates, past races, census data, and rolling election results. This year the big board got a big update. It can now look at individual voter districts, and it has a new feature called, “What If.” The latter is a magical algorithm that allows Kornacki to project possible outcomes based on single seat changes. Rather than making one big prediction about which way the election will go, Kornacki can give lots of little possibilities. These tools are meant to give nuance to local races, thereby painting a more refined portrait of the overall political landscape.\r\n\r\n"

These people are your friends. When they all dress up together, they perform rituals that make them feel important, remind them of their membership and of their enemies, who are lurking everywhere except for the group encircled around that burning cross. They call their rallies “Lightings,” not burnings. While they’re intended to inspire terror, they’re also opportunities for family picnics."

I also prefer to make my glue hot: 3 parts boiling water to 1 part flour + 1/4 cup salt (adding flour/salt to water slowly mixing using a hand blender). I then papier mache like crazy until the glue cools down (and then I stop!)"
