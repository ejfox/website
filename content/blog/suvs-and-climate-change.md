#### Notes

<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_power_law>

>The **fourth power law** (also known as the **fourth power rule**) states that the greater the [axle load](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axle_load "Axle load") of a vehicle, the stress on the road caused by the motor vehicle increases in proportion to the [fourth power](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_power "Fourth power") of the axle load.

>Last November, [attorney](https://www.vaccaroandwhite.com/) and safe streets advocate Adam White was biking up 4th Avenue in Brooklyn when he spotted a Chevy SUV with a piece of plastic blocking a digit on its license plate. He'd seen the same vehicle with the same obscured plate before, so he decided to pull over and peel it off. Then the owner of the vehicle got out, called the NYPD, and had White arrested for "criminal mischief," a misdemeanor.
