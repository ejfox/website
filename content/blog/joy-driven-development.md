## Embracing Joy-Driven Development: A New Philosophy for Better Work

I want to take some time to put into words the philosophy that has been guiding my approach to work for the past few years. My ideas and approaches have evolved as I have tried to explain these motivations to different collaborators, and I will try to distill that here.

The core of what I think of as "Joy-Driven Development" is a drive to embrace the sparks of joy that illuminate our work, guiding us along a path infused with curiosity and effortless innovation.

In this post, I'll discuss the principles of Joy-Driven Development and how it can lead to more fulfilling work experiences and better final products. Joy-driven development is an important piece of [[how-to-run-a-project]]

### Discovering the Spark: What is Joy-Driven Development?

Joy-Driven Development is an approach to software development that emphasizes the importance of enjoying the process of creating and building software. We should focus on creating a positive and fulfilling collaborative environment, where developers are motivated by their passion for coding, learning, and collaboration.

Instead of avoiding hard work or hard problems, we should make hard work *fun*.

This approach encourages teams to prioritize their happiness and well-being, which in turn leads to increased productivity, creativity, and overall better work. It is a counterpoint to more traditional development methodologies that may prioritize strict deadlines, rigid processes, and high-pressure environments.

### Curiosity As Fuel: Incorporating Joy

Finding the rhythm in Joy-Driven Development can be as simple as immersing yourself in projects that echo the beat of your natural curiosity. That does not always come naturally.

You have to set an intention to lean into what you are naturally drawn to. Harness your innate sense of wonder to propel your work forward, even when the reward remains veiled. By tapping into our curiosity, we find motivation and fuel that drive us forward. When joy is at the core of our work, the outcome is often better: joyful creators make joyful creations, leading to joyful users.

#### Follow the Joyful Compass: How To Approach Decision-Making

Embracing Joy-Driven Development is akin to navigating your creative odyssey with a compass forged from joy. As you face countless decisions, let each step be guided by the direction that invites the most joy for the people embarking on this voyage with you.

### Addressing the Skeptics

There may be misconceptions about centering joy in the work process, and it may come across as frivolous or lazy. However, Joy-Driven Development prioritizes both the experience of those working on the project and the quality of the final product. We focus on enjoying our work so *we can create better work*.

There are times when you need to do your chores, and that is not always fun. But having all of your chores done is joyful. Making a client happy is joyful. Creating work that makes the world better is joyful. If you can remember that as you hand-clean a dataset or debug a complicated SQL query, you can find the joy in those tasks too. Joy-driven development doesn't mean that we only do work that brings us joy, it means that joy is the gas that powers the engine.

By entwining threads of joy into the fabric of our work, we not only cultivate more satisfying experiences for ourselves but also craft joy-filled creations that resonate with users.
