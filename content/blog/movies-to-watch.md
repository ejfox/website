## Movies to Watch

For a variety of reasons there are many movies that I have not seen. Often in conversation, these movies will come up and people will say “you haven’t seen that?” and I feel pangs of guilt.

This is a list of all of those movies, cultural touchstones, that I should probably get around to watching at some point.

Wish me luck.
