    "extended": "Imprecise asks from managers and leaders cause a disproportionate amount of turmoil and wheel-spinning. To combat this, leaders should be very precise with the amount of time investment they’re asking for when they ask for things. A little bit of awkward precision up front can save major headaches down the line. Here’s some examples:\r\n\r\nClarify the expected time investment: “Please look into this for me. Do not, DO NOT, spend more than 20 minutes on this. Please come back with whatever you have after 20 minutes.”\r\nBe clear about how it should be prioritized: “I expect this to take about 2 weeks and not cause major deprioritization of other efforts. If that timeline doesn’t seem accurate after diving in, or if you end up having to prioritize against other things, reach out to me ASAP.”\r\nDistinguish between whether you’re looking for prior art or new art: “Tell me if we have anything on this topic already; if we haven’t even thought about it yet, that’s all I need to know.”\r\nTell people exactly what you’re going to use the information for so that they can calibrate effort levels: “I am going to put this into a response to a sales prospect”; “I need to know this just in case it comes up during Q&A at our next All Hands”; “this is going to be the main topic of our next board meeting”"
