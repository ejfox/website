I’ve never had the courage to want the world. I’ve always let it come to me, which of course is a rather passive approach to existence, but the funny thing is: inevitably, it comes. Sooner or later, whether I wanted it or not, the world came to me; it came at me, it keeps coming at me. — location: [604](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MT424DM&location=604) ^ref-15080

Once, I asked Jack if he loved me. “Of course I love you,” he said. “Then why don’t you ever tell me?” “It would be like having to tell you I’m breathing,” he said. “It would be like if, in a movie, the hero turned to the woman just before they ran into a barrage of gunfire, took her hand, and said, ‘Doris, I’m breathing.’ I’ve always been breathing. It would be like having her say, ‘I know. I’m breathing, too.’” [Linker] — location: [1142](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MT424DM&location=1142) ^ref-21482
