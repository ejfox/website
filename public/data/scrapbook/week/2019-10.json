    "extended": "Crypto people are always dismayed that I don't use signatures - on the face of it I am taking perfectly good Authenticity and throwing it away - an attacker could spoof my email address, send email to someone with whom they know I communicate and then encrypt with that persons key. This is, undeniably, a risk. The thing you should consider, though, is the other side of the coin. Quite simply, if you plan, at any point, to say something in encrypted email that you wouldn't want read out in court, DON'T SIGN ANYTHING EVER. The person you are sending to is about to have a plaintext copy of the communication, where you have undeniably linked the text with your private key. If that message leaks, gets snitched, if the other peer gets owned by HackingTeam (or whatever) then it's more or less Game Over. "
