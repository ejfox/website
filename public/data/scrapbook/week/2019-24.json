We see a lot of commercially-driven and non-peer reviewed research that make sweeping assessments of account behaviors only using public signals, such as location (if cited), account content, how often an account Tweets, and the accounts it follows. To be clear: none of these indicators are sufficient to determine attribution to a state entity definitively. Looking for accounts that look similar to those disclosed as part of our archives is an equally flawed approach, given many of the bad actors mimic legitimate accounts to appear credible. This approach also often wrongly captures legitimate voices who share a particular political viewpoint that one disagrees with."

He explains that while some tasks at work may fit into a larger, organization plan, the individual worker may not see where their individual task fits it. Second, limited feedback about one's work can reduce motivation and leaves the employee unaware of whether or not they did a good job. When there is little communication of feedback, an employee may not be assigned tasks that challenge them or seem important, which could potentially prevent an opportunity for flow.\r\n\r\n"
