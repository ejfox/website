The first involves \"custodial arrests.\" Here ICE \"arrests\" individuals whom another law enforcement agency has taken into custody for other reasons. This is simply a transfer of custody from one law enforcement agency to another. The principal program using this approach is known as the Secure Communities (SC) program.\r\n\r\n"

    "extended": "The combination of an ideologically-motivated (rather than financial) whistleblower with firsthand knowledge of the material they give alongside the editorial judgment of major outlets forms the bedrock of public interest journalism. Any attempt to swing the needle against that, or to criminalize it by tying it to hacking on a technicality, threatens quality journalism and threatens the free media. More simply than that, while Julian Assange may deserve punishment for other things he is accused of having done in his life, he does not deserve to be punished for what he published in 2010. Barring some new and major revelation, neither extradition nor prosecution over his work with WikiLeaks is merited."

A simple enough scam, yet highly effective: as May and other cypherpunks pointed out decades before, one should never entrust a pseudonymous agent with more liquid anonymous cash than its “reputation capital” is worth! One can entrust the agent with less liquid anonymous cash (not enough to burn one’s reputation in exchange for), or one could entrust the agent with more escrowed anonymous cash (so they cannot “rip-and-run”), but not both more and un-escrowed (which is paying them to scam you)."
