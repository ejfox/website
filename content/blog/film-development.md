## B&W 35mm Film Development Setup

#setup 

Two rolls must be developed at a time. One time I developed what I thought was 1 roll and it was 2 rolls and I lost a roll of film. RIP. Now developing one roll is illegal.

Once you've accumulated 2 matching rolls (no mixing!), the fun can begin:

### Loading rolls onto film holder

1. Get all materials set up [[step-zero]] and arranged
2. Put everything inside dark bag
3. Open up 35mm rolls of film
4. Cut the ends off and load them onto the plastic film holders
5. Put the film holders in the development cannister thing
6. Close everything up so it is light proof
7. Remove everything (including garbage) from the dark bag

### Developing rolls of film
1. Double check the film you are using and the developer [to make sure you are developing at the right temperature for the right amount of time](https://www.digitaltruth.com/devchart.php?Film=Kodak+Tri-X+400&Developer=Ilfosol+3%25&mdc=Search&TempUnits=F&TimeUnits=T)
2. Get your developer to the right temperature
3. Pour developer into cannister, follow agitation procedure for your specific film/developer
4. Pour our developer
5. Pour in stop bath 
6. Pour out stop bath
7. Pour in detergent
8. Leave to wash for a while under the tap
9. Pour out all water, lightly shake water off rolls
10. Pull rolls out of film holders
11. Gently squeegee the rolls to pull drops of water off
12. Clip film to hang and dry
13. Try to find a cool picture on the roll while it dries even though you can't see anything
### Cutting roll into contact sheet
1. Wait for the roll of film to completely dry
2. Put on dust or rubber gloves so you don't smudge your negatives
3. Trim off any excess film, and cut into strips with 5 photos each
4. Slide photo strips into archival plastic - sometimes I round the corners so they don't get caught when sliding them in
### Printing contact sheets
1. Pick archival sheet of photos
2. Put in contact sheet holder
3. Add paper at least 8.5 x 11
4. Remove any filters from the projector
5. Make test sheet for contact sheet, at 5 or 10-second intervals
6. Find correct exposure time for contact sheet, completely black blacks and full whites are ideal
