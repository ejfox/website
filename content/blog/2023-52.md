## 🌟 Overview of the Week

Went to my parent's house and had a nice relaxed Christmas.

Struggling a bit with giving myself the space to rest and relax without guilt or feeling useless.

## 💻 Key Projects & Progress

### LatentScope / Browser T-SNE

Did some experiments on doing T-SNE / UMAP in the browser to visualize embedding positions, rather than in Python on Google Cloud like we are doing now. Getting as many ML workflows out of Python and into Javascript (client or server) is one of my ongoing goals.

## 🎨 Creative Endeavors
### Sonic Pi Christmas Medley

After listening to a bunch of christmas music, I wanted to give it a shot. This is a Sonic PI script that randomly medleys between a few christmas classics, creating something unsettling, jazzy, and not entirely unlistenable.
