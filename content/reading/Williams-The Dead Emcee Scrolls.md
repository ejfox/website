The wind plays the world like an instrument. Blows through trees like flutes. But trees won’t grow in cement. And as heart beats bring percussion fallen trees bring repercussions.

In the beginning her tears were the long awaited rains of a parched Somali village. Red dusted children danced shadows in the newfound mounds of mascara that eclipsed her face, reflected in the smogged glass of Carlos’ East Street bodega. — location: [965](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FCKROM&location=965) ^ref-15019

Beneath the surface of our purpose lies rumor of ancient rain. Dressed in cloud-face, minstrels the sky. The moon’s my mammy. The storm holds my eye. — location: [990](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FCKROM&location=990) ^ref-31213
