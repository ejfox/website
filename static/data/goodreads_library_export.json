This book is in the same vein but less academic and more driving than I found his other books like Quicksilver. The case made here for the hidden and under utilized power of dormant magic, as defined here, and witchcraft is incredibly compelling. It provides a lens through which you can re-read history and entertain the idea of how magic might have influenced well-known events.","Spoiler":"","Private Notes":"","Read Count":"1","Recommended For":"","Recommended By":"","Owned Copies":"0","Original Purchase Date":"","Original Purchase Location":"","Condition":"","Condition Description":"","BCID":""}

As a freelancer, sometimes the lack of a clear 9-to-5 can make it hard to balance life and work. Setting aside time when you are booked to work is a smart way of making consistent work a habit, and helps you defend your productive time from intrusions. <br/><br/>I also really liked the idea of thinking using different perspectives when at a creative block. \"How would my old teacher solve this? How would a 5-year-old solve it? How would Steve Jobs solve it?\" <br/><br/>A quick read, like a buffet of techniques. Not all of it applied, but I was able to pick one the parts that did and they were very helpful.","Spoiler":"","Private Notes":"","Read Count":"1","Recommended For":"","Recommended By":"","Owned Copies":"0","Original Purchase Date":"","Original Purchase Location":"","Condition":"","Condition Description":"","BCID":""},
