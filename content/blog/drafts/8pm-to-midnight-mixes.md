# 8pm To Midnight Mixes

#dj #music 

Over the course of a year I put together a series of playlists built on the evolving vibes of a night of partying. As a DJ you get used to changing tunes to match the vibe of the audience, and I tried to capture the growing energy that happens.

The first playlist begins at 7PM, but I've been known to put it on first thing in the morning. It is calm background music as people gather and talk and hang out.

We build and increase the BPM over the course of the night, culminating with the midnight playlist, at which point everyone should be dancing. 

Total tracks: 135

Length of all playlists: 8 hours, 7 minutes, and 50 seconds
