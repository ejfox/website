    "extended": "Break up some clay in to small bits and if possible, let them dry out completely. Once dry, place them in a lidded container and add 50/50 water and vinegar. Add enough liquid to just cover the surface. Let sit over night so the clay can absorb the liquid. Once absorbed, give it a stir! If there are any chunks break them up with your fingers or a tool. The consistency should be that of a thick milkshake. The smoother the better. We like to keep ours in a container with a lid so we have it around when we need it. If it’s a little too wet, just let it sit open so some liquid can evaporate."
