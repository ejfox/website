With fluid interruption, responsive support and acute presence, we are aiming to disable oppressive structures in order to become the authors of our existence."

And they all have a designer’s name attached to them. The shit we design carries our name.\r\n\r\nYour role as a designer is to leave the world in a better state than you found it. You have a responsibility to design work that helps move humanity forward and helps us, as a species, to not only enjoy our time on Earth, but to evolve."
