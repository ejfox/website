# Highlights

One should shoot the subject from several different points and in varying positions in different photographs, as if encompassing it—not peer through one keyhole. Don’t make photo-pictures, make photo-moments of documentary (not artistic) value. — location: [450](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0041IXRM0&location=450) ^ref-27110

It seems to me it would be pretty difficult to be a portrait photographer for customers who order and pay since, apart from a Maecenas or two, they want to be flattered, and the result is no longer real. — location: [686](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0041IXRM0&location=686) ^ref-44744
