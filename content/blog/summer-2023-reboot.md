# Summer 2023 reinvention

So in June I am winding down all of my freelance contracts, moving out of my apartment in Beacon, and setting off on my my motorcycle (see [[motorcycle-camping]])

This is terrifying and exciting for me. 

## Considering full-time roles for the fall

## Doubling efforts on Room 302 Studio

## June-July 2023 Content Bank

The goal is to be able to go on vacation and still maintain momentum on social media and begin a rhythm of regularly producing content.

## 4-6 YouTube videos

I've been really inspired by the video series that Van Neistat created, which he filmed, edited, and banked and then slowly released over the summer. He covers all sorts of topics, specific stories, projects, and more philosophical thinking, as well as guidance on how to live and lessons he has learned. I want to find my own take on all of that. Almost like instructions on "how to be a person"… "existence manual"… something like that

1. The joy of motorcycle camping
2. Prototyper's manifesto: finding joy in creating things quickly
3. How to practice deep learning
4. Exploring the power of data journalism
5. The beauty of simplicity in code 
6. What the data interrogation process is like
7. How to think more critically about the data you use
8. What data journalism + visualization means to me

## 4-6 Twitter threads

I want some short Twitter threads that help people understand my dataviz expertise and helps people feel more empowered to create things and think critically about the world around them.

1. The power of data visualization
2. All this talk about Machine Learning…What does it mean?
3. How to use data-driven insights to tackle problems
4. What is UX and how can I use it better? 
5. Understanding the hidden stories behind the numbers
6. Dataviz — all you need to know to get started

## Electology Promo Content

Electology should be available for private invite-only beta testing in June. In order to promote the app and build excitement, I'm going to schedule a bunch of tweets with videos of me using various features and exploring design decisions I have made. 

1. Exploring historical elections with Electology
2. Novel data visualizations and analyses in Electology
3. How I create new dataviz components
4. An inside look at the design process behind Electology

## 4-6 Blog Posts

1. Rules for Travel
2. Homemade Artisan Soap-Making
3. Announcing Room 302 Studio
4. How I Use GitHub
5. Approach To Problem-Solving
