## My approach to a modern Scrapbook

On my iPhone, I have the Pins app, which allows me to take any link I see and add it to my Pinboard bookmarks, and even mark it as “read later”. Anytime I read something online I think I might want to reference, show someone, or think about later, I chuck it into my bookmarks.

Sometimes when I think about something, I’ll tweet about it. Or, I used to tweet about it, I post on Mastodon now, but same difference. These are like little tiny public-facing diary entries that capture my thoughts and thought processes on a particular day or topic.

I also write a lot of code. I’ll have a new idea, clone my template, make a little prototype, create a github repo for it, and if I’m a good little boy, I will fill it with Issues and notes of plans to enhance it later when I get more time.

I am also always exploring GitHub and finding new tools and technologies, which I star, to save for later. Sometimes I’ll also bookmark the repo and add it to Pinboard.

When I see images that I want to save, I use the service are.na instead, which is sort of like an adult tumblr with a lot of powerful capabilities around exploration and organization. Are.na lets you organize “blocks” which might images, text, or links, though I primarily use it for images. Blocks can themselves be organized into channels, and it is very easy to pull another user’s blocks into your own channels, and vice versa.

I also constantly take screenshots; of inspiration, of works in progress, weird glitches, and things that inspire me. This forms an interesting visual historical record of what I am working on at a particular time.

All of these things; mastodon posts, pinboard bookmarks, are.na blocks, can be thought of various scraps of paper sitting on my desk, clipped out from some source material. You could also think of them all as unique hypercards, to be stacked, grouped, and inter-referenced.

But a key missing element in making this workflow useful to me is building tools and interfaces for exploration and organization. I feel pretty confident about my mechanisms of *capture* - as I spin off a number of scraps every day without even thinking about it.

But I struggle seeing the over-arching themes and developments of projects on longer timelines. Some research, projects, or threads of exploration have lasted me years. At the time they felt like smaller, disconnected explorations. But when put together, in retrospect, some overarching threads become obvious.

I want to build more systems that help me recognize for
