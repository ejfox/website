        I make responsive infographics quickly. I started my career making
        static infographics in Illustrator, and after a decade of client work it
        still brings me a lot of pleasure. These static graphics are used to add
        context to a written piece, and I love partnering with journalists to
        help them tell their story. I like every step of the process, from
        scraping and data gathering, exploratory analysis and visualization to
        creating a beautiful responsive final product.

        Sometimes to tell a data story, it's easier to make understandable
        through interactive graphics. I've spent the last 10 years working in D3
        to create interactive data visualizations for mobile, desktop, and
        broadcast.

        I primarily use QGIS, Mapbox, and Cinema 4D to create maps for both
        personal projects and commissioned work. I enjoy making maps with
        election data, and exploring alternatives to choropleths.

        I pride myself in getting up to speed in new systems and making things
        exist quickly. These prototypes might be little scripts, Observable
        notebooks, or pitch decks. But I pride myself in creating focused and
        comprehensive minimum viable products from design and documentation to
        code.

        For the past year, I have been working more to create motion graphics
        for explanation and data visualization. Videos are a really cool
        opportunity to combine lots of different skills towards one goal:
        scriptwriting, data visualization, animation, data sonification. It is
        really challenging and rewarding, and a place I would like to continue
        to practice and grow.

    <p class="measure pt4">
      I call myself a <strong>hacker-journalist</strong>. I am a
      <strong>hacker</strong> in the sense that much of my time is spent
      convincing various computers to do my bidding, and I am a
      <strong>journalist</strong> in the sense that my bidding is often to
      discover, explore, or tell truthful stories about the world. Not all of my
      work pulls from these backgrounds equally, and there are times where I am
      mostly journalist or mostly hacker.
    </p>

    <p class="measure">
      My favorite moments are when someone says "I am not sure this is possible,
      but..." and then I can dive into the puzzle of unlocking the thing they
      don't totally believe can be done.
    </p>

    <p class="measure">
      I like creating things from nothing, making things exist. I love the
      challenge of making things exist on a deadline. I love the inherent
      deadlines in news, the need for speed and pragmatism and hard choices.
    </p>

    <p class="measure">
      A lot of people hire me to take an idea they have and make it exist with
      code. Because of this, and because every project is different, I find
      myself working up and down the stack, depending on the team and
      infrastructure I am working with. I am comfortable spinning up my own
      servers or SSH'ing into yours. I am comfortable hand-coding my own static
      webpages from scratch, or hacking your CMS to get everything working
      perfectly.
    </p>

    <p class="measure">
      I like working with teams of all sizes and disciplines. I really enjoy the
      process of learning new things and working with unique and diverse
      collaborators.
