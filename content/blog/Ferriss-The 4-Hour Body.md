# Highlights

“If I want a better-than-average career, I can’t simply ‘go with the flow’ and get it. Most people do just that: they wish for an outcome but make no intention-driven actions toward that outcome. If they would just do something most people would find that they get some version of the outcome they’re looking for. — location: [825](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003EI2EH2&location=825) ^ref-57810

“We are what we do repeatedly.” A mere five times (five workouts, five meals, five of whatever we want) will be our goal. — location: [1210](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003EI2EH2&location=1210) ^ref-21843

Use minimal arm movement and consider keeping your wrists near your nipples the entire time. During the initial 100-meter repeats, I purposefully ran directly behind the best ultra-distance runner in our group, matching his tempo and form. He ran with the shortest, most contained arm movements of all. — location: [6486](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003EI2EH2&location=6486) ^ref-36229

One lesson I learned stands out: Always do the minimum—the simplest, easiest experiment that will make progress. Few professional scientists seem to know this. — location: [7955](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003EI2EH2&location=7955) ^ref-17014

As Thorstein Veblen emphasized in The Theory of the Leisure Class (1899), useless research has higher status than useful research. Doing useless work, Veblen said, shows that you are higher-status than those who must do useful work. So researchers prefer useless research, thus the term “ivory tower.” — location: [7974](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003EI2EH2&location=7974) ^ref-29238

Gregor Mendel was a monk. He was under no pressure to publish; he could say whatever he wanted about horticulture without fear for his job. Charles Darwin was wealthy. He had no job to lose. He could write On the Origin of Species very slowly. Alfred Wegener, who proposed continental drift, was a meteorologist. Geology was a hobby of his. Because they had total freedom and plenty of time, and professional biologists and geologists did not (just as now), Mendel, Darwin, and Wegener were able to use the accumulated knowledge of their time better than the professionals. The accumulated knowledge of our time is more accessible than ever before. Self-experimenters, with total freedom, plenty of time, and easy access to empirical tests, are in a great position to take advantage of it. — location: [7995](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003EI2EH2&location=7995) ^ref-18003
