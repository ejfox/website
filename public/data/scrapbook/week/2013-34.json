    "extended": "Color developing is actually easier than black and white.  There are fewer steps, and it goes quicker.  The only real challenge is keeping the chems at the proper temp (around 102 degrees).  What I did was keep the chems in 500 ml bottles (used Lipton Green Tea bottles, actually) and set those in a small Igloo cooler that I had filled with water, and then put in a cheap ($8) aquarium heater to keep the temps stable.  It worked really well."
