We evaluate three state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods-QLoRA, ReFT, and Ortho-and show how algorithmic advances enable constant jailbreaking performance with cuts in FLOPs and optimisation power. We strip safety fine-tuning from Llama 3 8B in one minute and Llama 3 70B in 30 minutes on a single GPU, and sketch ways to reduce this further."
