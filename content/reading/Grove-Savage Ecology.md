# Highlights

There is a centuries-long investment in research, development, and deployment of techniques to ensure that survival is only ever a right for some. This right for some, more often than not, is ensured at the expense of the self-determination and continuation of living for the overwhelming majority of the planet’s human population. — location: [229](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07V5V2P1V&location=229) ^ref-3568
