It spans mind-boggling distances not only geographically but also politically, culturally, and spiritually. \n\nThe fact that these diverse corners of our spinning planet are bound together into one single united (forgive me) nation defies all odds. But oh boy does it feel comfortable as hell. I can read all the signs and we have a very nice interstate highway system.\n\nI have always found myself grateful when looking at a map of the world. Other countries are the size of our states. Some of them landlocked! Others aberrations; clearly sliced from larger countries in wars I would never be taught. Almost none of them are as large as the one I was born into. I wonder what their road trips must be like. \n\nSometimes when I’m doing a long drive, I picture showing my passport and submitting to inspections every time I cross a state line.

I don't even like McDonalds that much. \n\nYou find yourself very proud of American ingenuity when you see a brightly-lit, open McDonalds in the desert at 3AM two thirds through a cross country trip. \n\nWe have found some very specific things to become extraordinarily good at as a nation.\n\nFast cars, delicious food, large guns, hot (blonde) women.

(Doesn’t matter, in hard times relax from the inter-generational labor of your ancestors or whatever.)\n\nDespite an obsession in equal parts with working hard and relaxing hard, which seems healthy to me, America has torn itself into knots culturally. \n\nI keep wondering what can still unify us. \n\nThe powers that be seem to have fracked out every possible wedge that could be driven. Optimized by demographic groups and personal interests and TV preferences. Here we are, splintered, yelling at each other online (it does feel good if you’re in the right mood).\n\nCan you imagine people used to ask their neighbors for sugar?\n\n---\n\nOn May 1st in New York City in 2017 I found a group of Trump supporters surrounded by police, yelling insults and joking chants at the much larger crowd passing, assembled to celebrate [May Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Workers%27_Day) or International Workers’ Day (celebrated by socialists, communists, and all stripes of leftists). \n\nThe vulgar teenagers I encountered waved around a variety of flags and signs with symbols that referenced Trump and very online alt-right 4chan memes in equal measure.

They laughed with glee as they shouted meta self-referential memes. \n\nMost wore bright red hats with white lettering on the front.

The police halfheartedly shooed their would-be opponents away, telling them to get back to the sidewalk across the street, away from the red hat assemblage surrounded by the metal fencing surrounded by New York’s finest.\n\nThey kept thanking the police who were around to protect them.
