I do not currently have a place I could call home; I have rented for the past 13 years, going from apartment to apartment. I want to make an effort to write down and plan out my ideal living space; from the smallest detail to the largest.

I think this will be a philosophical as well as an architectural endeavor.

I know that getting everything I am wishing for his highly improbable; but I think the act of triangulating what I actually want to accomplish will get me closer to something that fits me. Putting it into writing, and speaking into the universe what it is I actually want is a profound act in its own. When put down into lists and writing, it seems simple, small, and humble. I am asking for as little as I possibly can; trying to make do with as little overhead and space and cost as necessary. I am not wishing for anything that is not actually attainable.

I want to create designs and systems for

- My desk / computer workspace [[home/workspace-and-desk|workspace-and-desk]]
- Kitchen [[home/kitchen|kitchen]]
- Garage / workshop [[home/workshop|workshop]]
- Garden / backyard [[home/garden|garden]]
- Meditation space [[home/meditation|meditation]]

I also want to take a very methodical, simple approach. The goal is to find the minimal viable solution, to fit the most utility in the most amount of space, and to create spaces and find tools and furniture that can accomplish at least 2-3 different goals at various times. I want to consider every possible detail and make the plans to put this into a reality, somehow.
