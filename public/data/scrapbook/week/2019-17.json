The researchers found that though some transient adverse effects occurred ‚Äî mostly a little anxiety at the beginning of the session, some confusion and nausea during the session ‚Äî there were no lasting adverse effects. The beneficial effects, however, did seem to hold up. All of the patients showed a marked reduction in depressive symptoms at one-week and three-month follow-up assessments, as well as improvement in symptoms of anxiety."
