## Goals & Inspiration

[[Thompson-Hells Angels]]

I want to share this setup to inspire others. This is in many ways a recipe for fun. I spent countless hours researching and finding the correct gear for my specific goals, and maybe that can save you some time that you can spend having adventures instead. 

Most of all; this is possible and doable. If you want to do it, you can make it happen. 

## Modularity

Generally every bag is a self-enclosed gathering of everything needed for a particular activity. Like layering clothing, bags are separated out and tiered so that essential items are always within reach. 

There are a few scenarios where bags get broken down, and it's important that their functionality is separate:

1. Checking in to a hotel/motel - no camping gear is needed, but a change of clothes and electronics are. How do I get everything to the room in as few trips as possible?
2. I drive my motorcycle to a marina where my friend is meeting me with a boat, what can I leave on my bike and what can I bring with me?
3. Camp is setup and we are taking a daytrip to another island or a hike up a trail and I want to bring a camera, art supplies, and other fun activites without lugging all my gear. 
4. The parking spot for a campsite is a

### What I look for in a bike
- Weight: I need to be able to pick it up and take it on single track
- Tires: It needs to be able to go off road
- Luggage: It needs to be able to carry all my camping gear

### How to find anything (what bag is it in?)

Another reason I am writing all of these things down are so that I can remember, or maybe even look it up later. As long as I follow the system and put everything back where it belongs, it is usually pretty easy to find everything I want. But sometimes I forget that I brought something useful, only to find it at the end of the trip. So it's nice to know everything that I am carrying at a glance, and where it should be.

## Camping

It helps if you already have a camping setup from backpacking or car camping. Camping off a motorcycle requires finding gear that can be condensed down to the smallest possible form. Space on the bike is precious and every square inch considered carefully.
