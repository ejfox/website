    "extended": "- Start with the author. Who wrote the book? Read his or her bio. If you can find a brief interview or article online about the author, read that quickly. It will give you a sense of the person\u2019s bias and perspective.\r\n- Read the title, the subtitle, the front flap, and the table of contents. What\u2019s the big-picture argument of the book? How is that argument laid out? By now, you could probably describe the main idea of the book to someone who hasn\u2019t read it.\r\nRead the introduction and the conclusion. The author makes their\u00a0case in the opening and closing argument of the book. Read these two sections word for word but quickly. You already have a general sense of where the author is going, and these sections will tell you how they\u00a0plan to get there (introduction) and what they\u00a0hope you got out of it (conclusion).\r\n- Read/skim each chapter. Read the title and anywhere from the first few paragraphs to the first few pages of the chapter to figure out how the author is using this chapter and where it fits into the argument of the book. Then skim through the headings and subheadings (if there are any) to get a feel for the flow. Read the first sentence of each paragraph and the last. If you get the meaning, move on. Otherwise, you may want to read the whole paragraph. Once you\u2019ve gotten an understanding of the chapter, you may be able to skim over whole pages, as the argument may be clear to you and also may repeat itself.\r\n- End with the table of contents again. Once you\u2019ve finished the book, return to the table of contents and summarize it in your head. Take a few moments to relive the flow of the book, the arguments you considered, the stories you remember, the journey you went on with the author.",

Then, inbound telepathy is about shipping that information to the user\u2019s head. Any decision a designer makes will either take the product closer to telepathy, or move away from telepathy.\r\n---\r\nIt\u2019s the \u201ccenter and periphery of attention\u201d bit that\u2019s interesting. As you\u2019re reading this, you\u2019re using the center of your attention, but there\u2019s a ton going on in your peripheral attention. Weather, temperature, amount of daylight, street noise, people, music, coffee steam, barking dogs, church bells, trains, the wooden chair. The center of attention, however, is a one-thing-at-a-time kind of a device, and making sense of language eats up most of it most of the time. So it does seem that the peripheral attention holds a larger promise. We can take in huge loads of information\u2014at the same time\u2014as long as it\u2019s not language. We already do.",

We see a lot of commercially-driven and non-peer reviewed research that make sweeping assessments of account behaviors only using public signals, such as location (if cited), account content, how often an account Tweets, and the accounts it follows. To be clear: none of these indicators are sufficient to determine attribution to a state entity definitively. Looking for accounts that look similar to those disclosed as part of our archives is an equally flawed approach, given many of the bad actors mimic legitimate accounts to appear credible. This approach also often wrongly captures legitimate voices who share a particular political viewpoint that one disagrees with.",

He explains that while some tasks at work may fit into a larger, organization plan, the individual worker may not see where their individual task fits it. Second, limited feedback about one's work can reduce motivation and leaves the employee unaware of whether or not they did a good job. When there is little communication of feedback, an employee may not be assigned tasks that challenge them or seem important, which could potentially prevent an opportunity for flow.\r\n\r\n",

A simple enough scam, yet highly effective: as May and other cypherpunks pointed out decades before, one should never entrust a pseudonymous agent with more liquid anonymous cash than its \u201creputation capital\u201d is worth! One can entrust the agent with less liquid anonymous cash (not enough to burn one\u2019s reputation in exchange for), or one could entrust the agent with more escrowed anonymous cash (so they cannot \u201crip-and-run\u201d), but not both more and un-escrowed (which is paying them to scam you).",

I daren't think I'm the first person to have thought such a thing, so I did a Google search and found some references to the idea elsewhere. It appears that Michael Tiemann of Cygnus Support (an open source software company) has been thinking along similar lines, and perhaps there are others too. It's certainly the case that commonly used Internet protocols such as TCP/IP and HTTP have attained a status akin to that of common law.\r\n\r\nAssuming one is willing to buy that analogy, then your question boils down to whether the development of this new branch of common law amounts to a heroic purpose. I believe that it is a great purpose and that it can affect society in ways that are more important and far-reaching than heroism in the glorious, swashbuckling sense. It is not, however, glorious and swashbuckling, any more than were all the efforts made by lawyers and magistrates over many centuries to build Common Law. This comes out of the fact that the development of open source software is of necessity a collective enterprise. Unless many people all over the world buy into it, it doesn't get developed, it doesn't get maintained, and it will not be widely adopted. Solitary geniuses need not apply; social and organizational skills are of the essence.",

This is, undeniably, a risk. The thing you should consider, though, is the other side of the coin. Quite simply, if you plan, at any point, to say something in encrypted email that you wouldn't want read out in court, DON'T SIGN ANYTHING EVER. The person you are sending to is about to have a plaintext copy of the communication, where you have undeniably linked the text with your private key. If that message leaks, gets snitched, if the other peer gets owned by HackingTeam (or whatever) then it's more or less Game Over. ",

    "extended": "In 1992 Bill McKibben \u201cspent many months of forty hour weeks\u201d attempting to watch twenty-four hours of television as recorded on ninety-one cable stations in Virginia (at the time, the most in the world). He wrote up his findings in the book, \u201cThe Age of Missing Information.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe believe that we live in the \u2018age of information.\u2019\u201d he writes. \u201cThat there has been an information \u2018explosion,\u2019 an information \u2018revolution.\u2019 While in a certain narrow sense this is the case, in many important ways just the opposite is true. We also live at a moment of deep ignorance, when vital knowledge that humans have always possessed about who we are and where we live seems beyond our reach. An Unenlightenment. An age of missing information.\u201d\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nBut \u2026 I want my attention back.\r\n\r\nDid I really have it before Facebook? Thinking back, the early versions of Facebook were adorable. Benign. No tagging. No timelines. Just The Wall. A way to say \u2014 Hey, what\u2019s shaking dorm buddy? Poke. No algorithms. A human scale.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nReturning to those (mythical?) halcyon minimalist information days: You could read all of the news in a single day. Grab the two or three papers and read. The information had edges; it could be understood by a single human over one cup of first-wave coffee. Were you insatiable, the library was available to dig deep on the topics of the day.\r\n\r\nIs this being too reductive? Too rose-tinted?\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nAttention is a muscle. It must be exercised. Though, attention is duplicitous \u2014 it doesn\u2019t feel like a muscle. And exercising it doesn\u2019t result in an appreciably healthier looking body. But it does result in a sense of grounding, feeling rational, control of your emotions \u2014 a healthy mind. Our measuring sticks for life tend to be optimized for material things, things easy to count. Houses, cars, husbands, babies, dollar bills. Attention is immaterial, difficult to track.\r\n\r\nWe deserve our attention.",

These people are your friends. When they all dress up together, they perform rituals that make them feel important, remind them of their membership and of their enemies, who are lurking everywhere except for the group encircled around that burning cross. They call their rallies \u201cLightings,\u201d not burnings. While they\u2019re intended to inspire terror, they\u2019re also opportunities for family picnics.",

    "extended": "For example, the spear-phishing emails that John Podesta, Clinton\u2019s campaign chair, and others received included links to the URL shortening service Bitly. \r\n\r\nThe Bitly account that created these links was registered using the email address \u201cdirbinsaabol@mail.com.\u201d The attackers used that same email address to create an account on a provider where they leased a server, which they paid for using an \u201conline cryptocurrency service\u201d (based on the wording of some instructions quoted in the indictment, I think the service in question may be BitPay). \r\n\r\nThis same cryptocurrency account was used to pay for registering the domain name dcleaks.com. This means that whoever was behind the spear-phishing campaign (and thus the DCCC and DNC hacks) also bought the domain name dcleaks.com, and also leased this server.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nHow could U.S. investigators know that Kovalev deleted his search history, as well as records belonging to multiple online accounts? Again, I believe the most likely scenario is that the NSA compromised his computer, accessed his browser history, and perhaps logged his keystrokes and took screenshots from his computer using a C2 server of their own.",

    "extended": "And so the beloved who, like a god, has received every true and loyal service from his lover, not in pretence but in reality, being also himself of a nature friendly to his admirer, if in former days he has blushed to own his passion and turned away his lover, because his youthful companions or others slanderously told him that he would be disgraced, now as years advance, at the appointed age and time, is led to receive him into communion. For fate which has ordained that there shall be no friendship among the evil has also ordained that there shall ever be friendship among the good. And the beloved when he has received him into communion and intimacy, is quite amazed at the good-will of the lover; he recognises that the inspired friend is worth all other friends or kinsmen; they have nothing of friendship in them worthy to be compared with his. And when his feeling continues and he is nearer to him and embraces him, in gymnastic exercises and at other times of meeting, then the fountain of that stream, which Zeus when he was in love with Ganymede named Desire, overflows upon the lover, and some enters into his soul, and some when he is filled flows out again; and as a breeze or an echo rebounds from the smooth rocks and returns whence it came, so does the stream of beauty, passing through the eyes which are the windows of the soul, come back to the beautiful one; there arriving and quickening the passages of the wings, watering. them and inclining them to grow, and filling the soul of the beloved also with love. And thus he loves, but he knows not what; he does not understand and cannot explain his own state; he appears to have caught the infection of blindness from another; the lover is his mirror in whom he is beholding himself, but he is not aware of this. When he is with the lover, both cease from their pain, but when he is away then he longs as he is longed for, and has love's image, love for love (Anteros) lodging in his breast, which he calls and believes to be not love but friendship only, and his desire is as the desire of the other, but weaker; he wants to see him, touch him, kiss him, embrace him, and probably not long afterwards his desire is accomplished. When they meet, the wanton steed of the lover has a word to say to the charioteer; he would like to have a little pleasure in return for many pains, but the wanton steed of the beloved says not a word, for he is bursting with passion which he understands not;-he throws his arms round the lover and embraces him as his dearest friend; and, when they are side by side, he is not in it state in which he can refuse the lover anything, if he ask him; although his fellow-steed and the charioteer oppose him with the arguments of shame and reason.

The only real challenge is keeping the chems at the proper temp (around 102 degrees).  What I did was keep the chems in 500 ml bottles (used Lipton Green Tea bottles, actually) and set those in a small Igloo cooler that I had filled with water, and then put in a cheap ($8) aquarium heater to keep the temps stable.  It worked really well.",
