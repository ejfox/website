## ðŸŒŸ Overview of the Week

Trying to decide whether I want to move when my lease is up in August. I hate moving. I want to get closer to the city, but even going back to beacon looks like an extra $1000 a month.

I forgot that Coach Artie was in my friend's Discord server and he ended up

### Amigo Sampler

Played around a bit with the [Amigo Sampler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB6mkL6x1DE) in Logic along with the [Push 64](https://www.ableton.com/en/push/) - definitely a lot of fun to play around with.

## Transcribing Videos with FFMPEG and Whisper.cpp

This week, I discovered a quick and efficient way to transcribe video files using FFMPEG and Whisper.cpp.

1. Convert the video files to 16-bit WAV audio format using FFMPEG:
```shell
for file in *.m4v; do ffmpeg -i "$file" -ar 16000 -ac 1 -c:a pcm_s16le "${file%.m4v}.wav"; done
```

2. Transcribe the resulting WAV files using Whisper.cpp:
```shell
cd /Users/ejfox/whisper.cpp
for file in /Users/ejfox/Downloads/FieldTalk/*.wav; do ./main -f "$file" -l en --output-vtt; done
```

3. Convert .vtt to plaintext
```shell
awk '!/-->/' CodeAndNature.wav.vtt >> CodeAndNature.wav.txt
```
