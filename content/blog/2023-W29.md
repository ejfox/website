#weekly

- Jumped into my Electology project [[why-i-am-building-electology-for-elections]] for the first time in a while and started tearing things out that did not spark joy. Mostly commenting out half-baked ideas and stubbed out concepts. The app feels really good though, just a few bugs that I filed for myself to fix later. It is very simple, but when I was going through the code I was pleased at the architecture I found. The front-end is pretty bulletproof, the next step is to build a resilient method of data cleaning and storage, a task I find enormous and intimidating.
