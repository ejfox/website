Not very impressive, but very easy and fun to put together. Really inspiring to feel the power of the limitations of this little tool.\n+ **Jan 7:** Made an example page of my [\"Internet Weather Report\"](https://dreamy-torvalds-1238a8.netlify.com/) website idea, AKA \"hipster drudge\" <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1547323648/Screenshot_2019-01-07_02.19.23.png\" />\n+ **Jan 6:** Did a directional arrow drawing on a blank puzzle I got from the art store\n+ **Jan 5:** Made first-ever linocut of an Air Jordan 1 mid I traced from a book. Pretty pleased with the results <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1547323425/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_2d82.jpg\" /> <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1547323384/Screenshot_2019-01-12_15.02.28.png\" /> \n+ **Jan 4:** Added watercolors to an older drawing, didn't really like the results though. Experimented with mixing large amounts of water and pigment in the bottom of mason jars for large washes with strong color to mixed results. Ended up being just being too much at once. Need to remember to leave negative space and let parts of the paper come through all the way to the end.  \n+ Jan 3: Same deal, I'm not good at doing things every day\n+ Jan 2: I fucked up and [played Hitman 3](https://twitter.com/mrejfox/status/1080255162671869953) literally all day and didn't make anything, literally day 2 of this thing, idk\n+ **Jan 1:** Traced type and linocuts from [*Type.
