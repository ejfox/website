# Introducing room302.studio

With a decade of data visualization contracting expertise under my belt, it gives me immense joy to introduce you all to my latest venture - [Room 302 Studio](https://room302.studio). As my projects became progressively more intricate, I realized the tremendous potential of forming a studio where talented collaborators could connect, innovate and strive together towards empowering the world through projects and processes that center joy and kindness. This dynamic studio sets up an exciting opportunity for taking on more ambitious projects that reflect our strong values.

We just published one of our first projects and I've done a tremendous amount of work to be able to say: we are open for business!
