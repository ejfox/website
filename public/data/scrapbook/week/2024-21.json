It will then create edge functions that handles your /server/api endpoints. I think this used to be the default until recently with nuxt / nitro, but I believed it changes recently, possibly in nitropack v2.4.0(?) to default to NITRO_PRESET=netlify, where I believe it doesn't create functions for the /server/api endpoints."
