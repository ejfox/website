Hi there! I'm **EJ Fox**, a freelance journalist and data visualization specialist. I've spent years exploring different ways to understand complex data and systems. I founded [room302.studio](http://room302.studio), an innovation lab, to take on larger projects and datasets. If you're interested in a fresh take on some data or just want to chat, reach out at [ejfox@ejfox.com](mailto:ejfox@ejfox.com) or [grab some time on my calendar](/calendar).
