It was not this that led them to ditch Marxism along with their sideburns and headbands, but the growing conviction that the regime they confronted was simply too hard to crack. It was not illusions about the new capitalism, but disillusion about the possibility of changing it, which proved decisive. — location: [115](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004V9IFDA&location=115) ^ref-30367

is true that capitalism works some of the time, in the sense that it has brought untold prosperity to some sectors of the world. But it has done so, as did Stalin and Mao, at a staggering human cost. This — location: [212](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004V9IFDA&location=212) ^ref-25037

The system has also proved incapable of breeding affluence without creating huge swathes of deprivation alongside it. — location: [214](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004V9IFDA&location=214) ^ref-47406

You cannot reorganise wealth for the benefit of all if there is precious little wealth to reorganise. — location: [220](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004V9IFDA&location=220) ^ref-33964

How would one avoid the chronic short-termism of markets, their habit of ignoring the overall social picture and the long-term antisocial effects of their own fragmented decisions? — location: [316](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004V9IFDA&location=316) ^ref-24899
