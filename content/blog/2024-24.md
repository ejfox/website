## ðŸŒŸ Overview of the Week


## Projects Worked On
- Created `git-status-dash` project to make a little dashboard for the status of various git repos in a folder, helped a lot by Claude: <https://github.com/ejfox/git-status-monitor>

### Video Recording

Finally accomplished my goal of recording an instructional coding video, preparing for recording a course on rapid prototyping with Nuxt.

Inspired by <https://maggieappleton.com/home-cooked-software> and <https://www.are.na/editorial/an-interview-with-spencer-chang> â€“ I wanted to show other people how easy it is to take your own data, in this case from are.na, and build your own interfaces and experiments from it.

For the video, I worked to get the necessary data from the are.na API, and then display it on draggable cards that remember their positions between sessions. I also added some basic controls for size, so you can arrange all of the blocks in a channel spatially in any way that makes sense to your brain
