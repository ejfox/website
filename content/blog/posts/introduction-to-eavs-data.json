The median % removed across the country was TK%. That’s a total of TK voters removed across the country between 2016 and 2018. \n\nA further analysis discovered TK% of counties had more voters removed than the difference in the last general election. \n\n*Map of counties where removal > 2016 vote difference*\n\nVoters can be removed from records for a few reasons:\n- Disenfranchising criminal conviction\n- Mental incapacity\n- Death\n- Change in residence\n- Never eligible: under 18 or noncitizen\n- Voter self-requests removal\n\nMany proponents of stricter voting procedures point to potential non-citizen voters. However the Brennan Center reported “out of the 23.5 million votes cast… election officials referred only 30 instances of suspected noncitizen voting, or .0001 percent of the total.”\n\nSome reasons for removal are broad and can cover a variety of situations. Because of this, these removals can happen in error. Two categories in particular deserve additional scrutiny: “Failure to Respond” and “Other / Not Stated”. \n\n*Graphic showing breakdown of reasons for voter removal: ideally sankey, could also be unit chart*\n\nLet’s look at some specific examples. Maricopa County in Arizona, which includes the city of Phoenix had the largest number of voters removed (223,369) by a single county in the EAVS data. Maricopa County was [recently called out in an article by The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/459832-the-10-counties-that-will-decide-the-2020-election) as one of 10 counties that will decide the 2020 election.\n\n> As partisan politics increasingly break down along urban and rural lines, Arizona Republicans are becoming more nervous. Arizona is the most urbanized state in the Republican column, and its most urban county, Maricopa, shows signs of inching left. \n> In 2016, Trump beat Clinton in Maricopa County by just 3 percentage points, a slightly lower margin than his statewide edge. Only one Republican in recent history has won a statewide election without winning Maricopa County.\n\n[ Maricopa-county specific sankey of reasons for voter removal ] \n\n[Purges: A Growing Threat to the Right to Vote](https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/publications/Purges_Growing_Threat_2018.1.pdf)\n\n> This data and analysis can provide voters, elected officials, and the media a deeper understanding of how elections are run as well as identify trends and emerging challenges.

In addition to these criteria, individuals who were never eligible in the first place, such as someone under 18 or a noncitizen, may be removed.

Miller, the Election Commissioner for Noxubee County’s fourth district.116 As of this writing, the ACRU is suing Starr County and the State of Texas for failing to purge aggressively enough, and the like-minded Judicial Watch has brought litigation in California.\n\n\n## Using Datasette\n \n## Creating a Makefile\n\n## Get election results by county\n- 2016 President\n- 2016 Congress\n- 2016 Senate\n- 2018 Congress\n- 2018 Senate\n\n## Do our analysis\n- 2016_P_diff\n- 2016_C_diff\n- 2016_S_diff\n- 2018_C_diff\n- 2018_S_diff\n\nGo through EAVS data and create the following fields\n- total_voters_removed\n- voters_removed_ftr – “failure to respond”\n- voters_removed_moved\n- voters_removed_other\n\nOnce those fields are bound to counties, look for counties where:\n• Total voters removed exceeds 2016 President vote difference `removed_exceeds_P2016_diff`\n• Total voters removed exceeds 2016 Congress vote difference `removed_exceeds_C2016_diff`\n• Total voters removed exceeds 2018 Congress vote difference `removed_exceeds_C2018_diff`\nPotentially add a new binary field, or make lists of those counties. \n\n## Visualize\n\n\n\n\n## Resources\nhttps://github.com/mbostock/ndjson-cli\n\nhttps://medium.com/@mbostock/command-line-cartography-part-1-897aa8f8ca2c\n\nhttps://medium.com/@mbostock/command-line-cartography-part-2-c3a82c5c0f3",
