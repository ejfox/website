# Highlights

What is the heart of the matter in pottery making? To call into being an object and to ask the object to have qualities that evoke in the viewer a sense of rightness, beauty, or vitality is to tinker with the divine. — location: [162](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008XOF5K0&location=162) ^ref-594

---

Establish the rim shape early in the throwing process, as early as the second pull, when you still have plenty of clay to work with. Setting the rim is an extension of compressing the top edge after every pull, which you want to do to keep the clay in good health. — location: [279](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008XOF5K0&location=279) ^ref-3342

Whatever the shape and structure of a cylinder, whatever the beginning and ending treatments, whatever the gesture and mood, all of the components must be unequivocal. They must manifest what they suggest and avoid what Henry James called the flaw of “weak specification.” 3 This demands decision making at every second of the throwing process and well-thought-out ideas that inform those decisions. — location: [365](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008XOF5K0&location=365) ^ref-57671
