As a freelancer, sometimes the lack of a clear 9-to-5 can make it hard to balance life and work. Setting aside time when you are booked to work is a smart way of making consistent work a habit, and helps you defend your productive time from intrusions. <br/><br/>I also really liked the idea of thinking using different perspectives when at a creative block. ""How would my old teacher solve this? How would a 5-year-old solve it? How would Steve Jobs solve it?"" <br/><br/>A quick read, like a buffet of techniques. Not all of it applied, but I was able to pick one the parts that did and they were very helpful. ",,,1,,,0,,,,,
