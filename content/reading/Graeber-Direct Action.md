# Highlights

“What bothers me about the whole concept of pacifism,” says Mac, “is that it’s fundamentally elitist. Poor people—people who have to live every day with violence by police, who are used to it, who expect it… they’re not going to see anything admirable, let alone heroic, in inviting police violence, and then facing it passively.” — location: [456](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0051QH31W&location=456) ^ref-47569
