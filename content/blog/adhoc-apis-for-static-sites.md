So you have a bunch of data and youâ€™ve built a nice frontend for it. But its a bit too big to have your users download the entire thing, but too small to dedicate hosting a database for it forever. What are your options?

## Host and client-side query Parquet

## Intelligently chunk into static data assets

## Use sqlite and datasette for an API

## Put your large data on S3 or Cloudflare

## Put your data into a Supabase project
