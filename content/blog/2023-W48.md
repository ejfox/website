# 🌟 Overview of the Week
- *General Mood & Key Themes*: 
  - Summarize the general mood and key themes of the week here. 

# 💻 Key Projects & Progress
- [Added GPT-4 vision to Coach Artie](https://github.com/ejfox/coachartie_discord/commit/7df062f59ffd54e68e86f58fecd1f6ec004fa106) so that when he gets sent an image on Discord, he converts it into a text description before moving onto building a response. 
- Working on an upgraded and refactored version of my [website](https://github.com/ejfox/website) with a new design and the addition of a scrapbook so I can show the process of gathering research, inspiration, and drawing connections between ideas in public.

# 🎨 Creative Endeavors
I've been playing around more with waterproof inks at various dilutions in bottles and brushes. I really like the way it looks when it dries, almost like watercolor, it has an innate fluidity to it. But it is hard to control and I frequently get way too much water or ink in a spot where it pools and takes forever to dry and warps the paper. 

- *Art & Writing*: 
  - List art created, mediums used, and significant writings or quotes. 

# 📘 Learning & Development
- Watched [The Divorcee (1930)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Divorcee): "You'll never die yearning"

- *Material Consumed*: 
  - Note movies, podcasts, books, and articles that influenced you. 
- *Kindle Highlights*: 
  - Include standout Kindle highlights here. 

# 💡 Technical Accomplishments
- Made a [very basic ffmpeg script](https://gist.github.com/ejfox/4eed331a94ea0727bd7c996a2e681ae5) that takes a long MP3 and splits it up into separate files where it detects silence. 
## Netlify Dashboard
I wanted a [super-simple dashboard](https://github.com/room302studio/netlify-dashboard) of all of my Netlify deploys, particularly pulling out any build errors so I can fix them. One of the side-effects of creating many prototypes is that their deploys must be monitored as they are updated and various libraries / frameworks / etc change.

- *Development Breakthroughs*: 
  - Describe coding or development achievements.
