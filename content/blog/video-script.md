## Opening Image - Intriguing Start

>Paint an opening image or scenario that sets the tone for your video, like a question or a statement. A strong start is essential to capture the viewer's attention right away. Convey a glimpse of the central topic to pique curiosity.

## Immediate Entry Point - Introduction

>Start with a narrative punch – either a thought-provoking statement, intriguing question, or a surprising fact related to your topic. This strategy quickly immerses your audience in the topic at hand and kickstarts the intellectual journey.

So the other day, I had this idea...

## 'Ordinary World' Deconstruction - Unveiling the Topic

>Initiate the exploration of your 'ordinary world' by presenting an unexpected angle, anomaly, or puzzle in your complex topic. By highlighting what is about to be deconstructed and understood in the upcoming segments, you foster curiosity, encouraging viewers to remain engaged as the mystery unravels.

## Presenting 'The Call to Adventure' - Launch Segments

>Here, lay out the first step of the deeper exploration. Divide the complex topic into segments, each examining a unique element. Like Dan Harmon’s story circle, this initial segment should present a challenge or question that disrupts the ordinary world.

## 'Crossing the Threshold' and 'Road of Trials' - Segment Walkthrough

>Delve into your subject's different segments in depth. Each segment should represent a challenge or stage that, when conquered or comprehended, brings viewers closer to understanding the abstract or complex topic.

## 'Master of Both Worlds' - Summarization and Key Takeaways

>With a nod to Harmon’s structure, provide a summary that shows viewers how what they’ve learned has reshaped the 'ordinary world'. Highlight the key takeaways that viewers can utilize or relate to their own lives.

## Viewer Engagement - Call-to-Actions

>Promote interaction with direct calls-to-action, such as "subscribe," "like," or comment prompts for further discussion. Include participation elements that keep the conversation going beyond the video. Encourage your audience to share how the video's lessons could apply in their worlds.

## Return - Final Message

>Cap off with appreciative closing remarks. Thank the audience for their time and interaction, share what's coming next if appropriate, or leave viewers with an inspiring thought to keep them thinking about your topic even after the video ends.
