## How to make a new photo post

Make sure the following environment variables are set in your .env file:

- CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
- CLOUDINARY_API_KEY
- CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET

As of Jan 2021, all 3 of these values can be found by logging into
https://cloudinary.com

If starting in Lightroom, you want to go through each photo and make sure it
has a caption. You can add the caption in the Metadata section on the
right side of the screen when in Library mode. These captions will automatically
be displayed when processed with the script. This is basically the only way to
get text into photo blog posts.

Once you have gathered all of the photos you would like to publish, select
them all and export them to a folder. Take note of the path of this folder
with a tool like `pwd`, as we will need to pass it to our script.

In the root of this website, you want to run

```bash
node folder-to-blogpost.js ~/PATH/TO/IMAGES/ post-slug
```

If no post-slug is provided, the slug of the folder will be used. 
This generates a file in ~/website/content/photos/SLUG.json - 
these files are automatically detected and shown as photoblog posts.

This will also take every photo and process it by uploading the image to
Cloudinary, and then writing the public uploaded Clouindary URL as well
as the relevant EXIF data (most importantly captions) and writes it to a
JSON file. That JSON file will be moved to `content/photos/` so it can be
displayed as a post on the photoblog, which checks for all .json files
located in that directory.
