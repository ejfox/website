        Infographics and data visualization are the perfect way to add context
        to your written content. I have over 10 years of experience crafting
        static infographics in Illustrator, and I am passionate about helping
        journalists and start-ups tell their stories. I offer a complete suite
        of services, from data scraping and analysis to visualization and
        responsive design, all tailored to your specific needs.

        Sometimes to tell a data story, it's easier to make understandable
        through interactive graphics. I've spent the last 10 years working in D3
        to create interactive data visualizations for mobile, desktop, and
        broadcast.

        For the past year, I have been working more to create motion graphics
        for explanation and data visualization. Videos are a really cool
        opportunity to combine lots of different skills towards one goal:
        scriptwriting, data visualization, animation, data sonification. It is
        really challenging and rewarding, and a place I would like to continue
        to practice and grow.

    <p class="measure pt4">
      I am a hacker-journalist. I spend much of my time convincing various
      computers to do my bidding, which is often to discover, explore, or tell
      truthful stories about the world. I have a background in journalism and
      computer science, and I use both skillsets to create powerful and
      compelling visualizations.
    </p>

    <p class="measure">
      I love a challenge. When someone comes to me with an idea that they're not
      sure is possible, I am excited to dive into the puzzle of making it
      happen. My favorite moments are when I can turn something that someone
      thought was impossible into a reality.
    </p>

    <p class="measure">
      I like creating things from nothing, making things exist. I love the
      challenge of making things exist on a deadline. I love the inherent
      deadlines in news, the need for speed and pragmatism and hard choices.
    </p>

    <p class="measure">
      A lot of people hire me to take an idea they have and make it a reality
      with code. As a result, I have a lot of experience working up and down the
      stack, depending on the team and infrastructure I am working with. I am
      comfortable hand-coding my own static webpages from scratch, or hacking
      your CMS to get everything working perfectly. My benefit is my
      versatility. I am always up for a challenge, and I enjoy the process of
      making something exist.
    </p>

    <p class="measure">
      I enjoy working with teams of all sizes and disciplines. I am always keen
      to learn new things, and I love working with unique and diverse
      collaborators. No two projects are the same, but I believe that respectful
      and open communication is key to a successful project no matter what.
