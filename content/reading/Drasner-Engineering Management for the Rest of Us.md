## Highlights
Hearing each other out: Conflict is not always bad. Sometimes you need to have healthy debates to come up with the best plan and outcome. You can only do this when there’s trust in the group and between team members. — location: [341](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BGYVDX35&location=341) ^ref-3692

You may notice that I say this again and again: you as a leader have to go first. You have to show you can be trusted, and you have to be trusting. This means being okay with being vulnerable with your team. It means explaining to them how and why you care about their well-being, in words and in actions. — location: [360](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BGYVDX35&location=360) ^ref-65215
