# Highlights

There was one day when my only goal was to verify three numbers in a dataset, because when The New York Times graphics desk creates a graphic, it makes sure what it reports is accurate. Only after we knew the data was reliable did we move on to the presentation. It’s this attention to detail that makes its graphics so good. — location: [112](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005CCT19M&location=112) ^ref-18691
