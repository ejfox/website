## ðŸŒŸ Overview of the Week

House-sitting for my parents and starting to bring stuff to the storage unit- taking a bit in the peace and quiet to work on some of my personal projects and plan my future a little bit.

I've been writing a lot of code- it would be great to get to a place in a few of my projects in the stage where I need to sketch / design the UX and flow and interactions instead of writing code.

## Projects Worked On


### Scrapbook

Continuing to work on my Scrapbook project, even though I am not sure why, it makes me happy to work on it. But it is difficult to explain the value, or exactly what benefit it will bring me. But I persist.

### Connectology

Continuing to play with my Connectology project. Worked on moving the network pan/zoom state to its own composable. This lets me show the network as both SVG and ASCII and still let the user pan and zoom around. Also added some fun sound effects when adding or connecting nodes, or shuffling the position.

### Netlify Dashboard

I have been working on so many projects, it is hard to see the build status of all of them in one place. I took some time to add some information hierarchy to the cards.

## Creative Endeavors

### JZULY music

Josh, Ben, and I took 2 days in the studio to record 30 demos using the live looper. Since then, each of us have 6 songs to polish in Logic, and I spent a bunch of time working on mine.
