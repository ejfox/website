What if Sydney wasn't trained on OA RLHF at all, because OA wouldn't share the crown jewels of years of user feedback and its very expensive hired freelance programmers & whatnot generating data to train on? What if the pretraining vaguely alluded to, which somehow left in embarrassingly ineradicable traces of 'Sydney' & a specific 2022 date, which couldn't simply be edited out of the prompt (implying that Sydney is not using solely prompt engineering), was in fact just regular ol' finetune training?"
