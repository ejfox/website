However, we won't be doing anything hugely sophisticated, so advanced knowledge is not required.\r\n\r\nYou don't have to be a musician or an expert in music theory to follow this guide. I'm neither of those things. I'm figuring things out as I go and it's perfectly fine if you do too. I believe that this kind of stuff is well within reach for anyone who knows a bit of programming, and you can have a lot of fun with it even if you aren't a musician."

The v-gouge is the most versatile as you can cut a variety of width of line, including the finest lines. If you want to cut an even width of line, a u-gouge is easier. You can also use a scalpel to cut a line similar to the v-gouge but you have to cut each side of the line separately. If you want to clear large areas, a wider, flatter gouge will save you time."

The goal of its idealistic creators was to use cutting-edge cartography to better inform the public about the water policy issues confronting the state."
