A historical tour of the Catskills, marking the site of Woodstock ’69, and heading north all the way up to the famed Kaaterskill Falls. This route cuts through ravines with twists and turns that we could ride for days."

It is\r\nmost suitable in generalized contexts, where knowledge of the Buddhist background of\r\nmindfulness cannot be expected. The 14 items cover all aspects of mindfulness.\r\nThe purpose of this inventory is to characterize your experience of mindfulness. Please\r\nuse the last ___ days as the time-frame to consider each item. Provide an answer the for\r\nevery statement as best you can. Please answer as honestly and spontaneously as\r\npossible. There are neither ‘right’ nor ‘wrong’ answers, nor ‘good’ or ‘bad’ responses.\r\nWhat is important to us is your own personal experience. "
