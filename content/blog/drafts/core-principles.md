When making things on the internet, the attraction of just doing what other people want is always there. But I think when making things on the internet, there are a few key principles that I believe in.

## The truth is paramount

This simple principle is applied in nearly every possible place. Everything I say is truthful, to the best of my ability. I research, follow standard journalism ethics and standards, and only say things that I know to be true.

I think this also applies to the way that things are shot and created; I want to be as honest to the moment as possible, and sometimes this might mean emphasizing authenticity at the expense of quality.

I prefer natural light to fancy complicated lighting setups. I prefer recording everything as early as possible, rather than going back and "recreating" key moments. I prefer letting people be their authentic selves, with minimal direction as to what they should say or do.

This also means, when I get things wrong, *issuing corrections* and clarifying why the mistake happened, and what was learned.
