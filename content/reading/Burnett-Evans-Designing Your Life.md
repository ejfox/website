# Highlights

Try Stuff. When you have a bias to action, you are committed to building your way forward. There is no sitting on the bench just thinking about what you are going to do. There is only getting in the game. Designers try things. They test things out. They create prototype after prototype, failing often, until they find what works and what solves the problem. — location: [294](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=294) ^ref-27991

A well-designed life is a marvelous portfolio of experiences, of adventures, of failures that taught you important lessons, of hardships that made you stronger and helped you know yourself better, and of achievements and satisfactions. — location: [346](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=346) ^ref-13551
